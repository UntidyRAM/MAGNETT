MAGNETT is a proof of concept device (or gadget) that allows one to retrieve measurements taken from a G-856AX (manufactured by Geometrics, Inc) over a WiFi connection. It has the ability to save a GPS position for each measurement taken by the G-856AX. It also displays the retrieved data in a table and graph on the web server.
